# State fields — `/states`

Edit the territorial content of **existing** states — ownership, cores/claims, manpower, resources,
buildings, victory points.

> ⚠️ **States are EDIT-only — there is no "create a state".** A fresh project has no states. First bring
> vanilla states in with `POST /states/seed-from-vanilla` (`{state_ids: [...]}` or `{all: true}`), then
> `PUT` the ones you want to change. (Imported-mod projects already have their states.)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `owner` | owning country TAG |
| `controller` | controlling country TAG (nullable = no distinct controller) |
| `state_category` | free-text size category (`city` / `town` / `wasteland` / `megalopolis` / …) — **not an enum** |
| `manpower` | state population/manpower (int) |
| `resources` | dict `{strategic_resource: amount}` |
| `add_core_of` | `list[TAG]` — countries that core this state |
| `add_claim_by` | `list[TAG]` — countries claiming it (parallel to `add_core_of`) |
| `remove_core_of` | `list[TAG]` — cores to remove |
| `victory_points` | `list[dict]` — VP placements |
| `set_province_controller` | `list[dict]` `{province_id, controller}` |
| `buildings` | state-level building levels dict |
| `province_buildings` | per-province building placement (serialized under the hood) |
| `impassable` | wasteland marker (`impassable = yes`) |
| `impassable_ignored_links` | 1.19+ · **raw inner list** of neighbor state ids an impassable state keeps its connection to (send `"1024"` or `"1024 1025"`; export wraps it as `impassable_ignored_links = { … }`) |
| `display_name_locs` | `{"en": str, "zh": str}` (partial ok) — rename the state via localisation override. **Replace-whole-dict on PUT** (send the full dict, like other dict fields). Read side also returns derived `display_name` = resolved `{en, zh}` (your override first, vanilla name as fallback) |

No raw-script fields — states are structured territorial data.

### Common quirks
- **PUT only** — you edit an existing state (seeded or imported), you don't POST a new one.
- `state_category` is free text, not an enum — custom categories are allowed.
- Don't hand a country a state it shouldn't own at start (esp. another country's capital) → in-game
  `capital … they don't own it` noise.
- Renaming = `display_name_locs` only. The state definition's `name = "STATE_<id>"` loc key never
  changes (see below).

## Platform workflow (hagane.works)
The full territory chain — MCP or REST, same data:
1. **Seed** — MCP `seed_states_from_vanilla(state_ids=[...])` / REST `POST /states/seed-from-vanilla`
   `{state_ids: [...]}`. Copies the real vanilla definitions (provinces, manpower, buildings, exact
   vanilla filename) from the platform's current-game-version snapshot into your project.
2. **Locate** — MCP `get_states(name_query="Borneo")`. Rows include `display_name_en` /
   `display_name_zh`; `name_query` is a case-insensitive contains-match on the en/zh display name, the
   raw `STATE_<id>` loc key, or an exact state id (applied before the row cap).
3. **Edit** — MCP `edit_state(...)` / REST `PUT /states/{id}`: `owner`, `add_core_of`, `buildings`, …
   plus `display_name_en` / `display_name_zh` (REST: `display_name_locs`) to rename.
4. **Export** — the platform writes each edited state under its **vanilla original filename**
   (filename-shadowing) and emits the rename as a `STATE_<id>` localisation override.

⚠️ **Never write a `provinces = { … }` block from memory** — it must come from the seed tool or a real
game file on disk. Memory-written province lists are version-stale (333 British Borneo split into three
states in 1.16; Southeast Asia redrawn again in 1.19) → the same provinces get defined twice →
tug-of-war / ownerless provinces / CTD.

### "The filename does not determine how the file is handled" — what the wiki means
The game reads the state **id from the file's contents**, not from the filename — any filename parses.
But to **override** a vanilla state your file must ship under the **exact same filename** as vanilla's
(irregular: `333-British Borneo.txt` vs `1023 - Brunei.txt` — record verbatim, never synthesize):
same-name files shadow, exactly one definition wins. A different filename means BOTH definitions load →
double-defined provinces → tug-of-war. The platform export does the same-name shadowing for you.

### Renaming a state = localisation override
The state file keeps `name = "STATE_613"` forever; the rename is a loc line the export emits for you:

```
l_english:
 STATE_613: "New Name"
```

⚠️ No `:0` version suffix on an override line — tested in-game, `STATE_613:0 "…"` triggers a
loc-key collision that vanilla wins (the rename silently fails). Bare `KEY: "text"` overrides cleanly.

Set it via `display_name_en` / `display_name_zh` (MCP) or `display_name_locs` (REST) — never edit the
`name` loc key itself.
